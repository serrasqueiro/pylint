Branched https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint.git .
Created new branch: new/help_me_hm .

Avoided annoying complaints about single space after/ before brackets.
The main change was at 'format.py':
- https://github.com/serrasqueiro/pylint/commits/new/help_me_hm/pylint/checkers/format.py
then merged to the master of this fork:
- https://github.com/serrasqueiro/pylint/commits/master/pylint/checkers/format.py

Another way would be to check a different handler,
	'C0326: No space allowed after bracket'
	at format.py: ...  "C0326": ( ... )
instead of C0326.
